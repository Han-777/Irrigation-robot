# Irrigation-robot

  

This repository provides 2 versions codes for irrigation-robot. `Version1` is for Cortex-m4 and is developed on bare-metal. `Version2` is for Cortex-m7 and is developed on `FreeRTOS`. All software framework is based on https://gitee.com/hnuyuelurm/basic_framework. On that basis, I migrated the framework to the cortex-m7 kernel and add some new features.

## ðŸ“Œ Problems remain to solve 

- [ ] Dual-board communication
- [ ] Road identification scheme
- [ ] System stability
- [ ] The degree of code coupling at the application layerã€‚
- [ ] ....
